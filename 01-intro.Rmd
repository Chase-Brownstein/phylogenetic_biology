# Introduction {#intro}

Phylogenetic biology is the study of evolutionary relationships.


There are three components to a phylogenetic analysis: characters, evolutionary models, and phylogenetic trees. In any given study we could have data, not care, or want to infer any three of these. 

When we don't care, we marginalize. When we have data we fix. When we want to infer we estimate.

This gives a broad range of hypothetical phylogenetic investigations. Only a subset of these are common in the literature, due to the questions that drive the field right now, the available data, and the methods that have been implemented in software tools.

When we want to infer phylogenetic trees, we usually fix the characters at the tips using our data, marginalize over historical character states, estimate models, and estimate the tree.

When we want to infer the history of character evolution, we often fix the tree, fix the characters at the tips using our data, estimate the model, and estimate the character history.

But we can also marginalize over models, for example.
