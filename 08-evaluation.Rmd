# Evaluation

## Model selection

Once you have your data matrix (or matrices), and before you do your phylogenetic inference, it is critical to consider which model to use. We examined the mathematic structure of several models in earlier chapters, but we didn't examine how to decide which model to use.



## Running the inference

## Computational considerations


Why not add as many parameters as you can imagine?

Likelihood ratio test

AIC

BIC

## Topology evaluation

## Sensitiviy

changing methods and parameters

adding noise


## Confidence

Propogation, point estimates
